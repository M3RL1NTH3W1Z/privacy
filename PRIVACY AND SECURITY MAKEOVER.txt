PROCESS FOR REVAMPING YOUR DIGITAL INFORMATION

While your identity may already be imprinted within the internet due to 
third parties involved in the mass collection of information to be sold
to the public, its still possible to proactively work on keeping your 
accounts and information privatized. Contrary to popular belief, the 
methodologies presented in this series may be considered "paranoid".
However, it is imperative that the public knows how to masquerade their 
information in order to thwart scammers, stalkers, and other kinds
of nefarious individuals or organizations willing to pay the price
for a persons personal information. 

This will be an ongoing series of documents outlining a step by step 
plan to redesign the way we think, act and handle our information online.
It will not be the most conveinent way of things, but know that
conveinence has been taken into consideration by me. 

This series will cover a variety of topics, including: 

-Open Source Intelligence gathering, in order to develop a picture of your digital identity
-Creating a plan to reduce your footprint online 
-Implementing a more secure architecture for accounts you own
-Sending formal requests to third parties to get rid of your personal information collected
-Device hardening techniques, along with reviewing different operating systems 
-Antivirus solutions, Firewalls, best browsers and VPN providers
-Masquerading your home address
-Multi-Factor Authentication setup 
-Recovery Plans
-Password creation and Password Management

“We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom. We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success. We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all.” -Nelson Mandela
