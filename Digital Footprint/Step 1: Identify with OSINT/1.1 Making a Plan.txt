1.1 MAKING AN OPEN-SOURCE IDENTIFICATION PLAN FOR YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prefix: In order for us to be able to identify and combat the commercial usage of our private information, 
it is imperative that we begin to understand exactly HOW much of our information is out there. A great way 
for us to begin this journey of cleaning it all up, is by developing a plan to identify what we currently 
know about ourselves online. Please note that some of the tools identified will ask for some money. I hope 
to eventually create an all-in-one collection tool that utilizes the APIs of these third party services 
someday to make this a lot easier and even more affordable for the reader (i.e. you)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO BEGIN: Write down on a piece of paper, everything you know about yourself digitally, even from when you
were a kid. This includes things such as:

-Usernames 
-Passwords 
-Nicknames 
-Email Addresses 
-Current and Past phone numbers 
-Social Media and other Accounts you recall using 
-Current and former home addresses
-Any sort of password sharing provider you MAY have used (Lastpass, Dashlane, etc.)

Keep this note stored in a safe place, as this is EVERYTHING you know about yourself online. This is our gameplan. 
We will use this to understand more about ourselves, how our information is being used across the internet, along with what we 
need to clean up.
